Short Description of NBK:

NBK is Japan based organization and 465 years old company which manufacturers world class
couplings, Special Screws and Machine Element. Apart from NBK Products are using in Various
Industries like Semiconductor, Medical, Machine Tool and Robotics.

SEIMITSU Factory Automation Pvt. Ltd. is an authorized distributor of NBK in India.

What is coupling:
A Coupling is a device in order to connect two shafts (Motor and Gearbox) together at their ends for the purpose of transmitting power and torque to the gearbox the main purpose of coupling is to avoid misalignment of two rotating pieces of equipment. Basically, the coupling is a mechanical device that is used to cater ends of adjacent parts. During operation, couplings work fully functionally disconnection is never possible however sometimes due to exceeding the torque limits, there may have chances for couplings to slip or disconnect but torque-limiting couplings are used.

Features of High Gain Rubber Type Couplings:

•	The High Gain Rubber Type Couplings suppress hunting, improve limit gain of servomotors, thereby reducing their stabilization time.
•	These couplings speed and torque unevenness, caused by misalignment, will be suppressed
•	Because of the couplings high damping ratio, they enable quick vibration absorption
•	Using these couplings causes actuator drive noise to be reduced.
•	Comparing these couplings with disk and slit couplings, higher torque is allowed
